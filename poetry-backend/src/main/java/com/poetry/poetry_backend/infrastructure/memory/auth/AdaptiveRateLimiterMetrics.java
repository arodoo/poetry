/*
 * File: AdaptiveRateLimiterMetrics.java
 * Purpose: Encapsulates mutable counters for adaptive rate limiter to
 * separate metric bookkeeping from core control logic reducing file
 * length in adapter while keeping monitoring accessors. It provides
 * simple increment and snapshot style getters to expose internal state
 * for tests and instrumentation without leaking mutability.
