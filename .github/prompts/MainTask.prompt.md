Main task:
- Re-construction of 'oldRepo' inside 'poetry-backend' & 'poetry-frontend', but this
time following the new structure and conventions.

Structure and conventions defined at '.github\instructions\globalInstructions.instructions.md'.
Expected pages defined at '.github\instructions\expectedPages.instructions.md'.

- Configurations must keep the same as in 'oldRepo', but with the new conventions.
- Files tree must be improved according to the new conventions.
- Incongruencies must be detected and fixed.
- Tests must be added and passed in every integration.
- (Most part of the logic is already implemented in 'oldRepo', just needs to be adapted to the new conventions.)
