# 60/60 RULE

MAX: 60L/file, 60char/line (CI@80). JSON exempt. PRE-WRITE: Lines>=50 OR
chars>=55? SPLIT NOW. SPLIT: DDD layers (domain/app/infra), 1 concern/file
NEVER: Compress, defer, ignore DDD MAX: Entity(50L) ValueObj(30L) Service(60L)
UseCase(55L) DTO(40L) Mapper(45L) Repo(60L) Adapter(55L)

## NEVER

- Create files over 60 lines "temporarily"
- Assume you'll refactor later
- Compress code to fit (remove spaces, shorten names)
- Ignore limits because "it's just a few lines"

## ALWAYS

- Count lines as you write
- Split proactively, not reactively
- Keep each file focused on ONE responsibility
- Respect the 60/60 buffer (CI fails at 80/80)

REMEMBER: Fixing violations manually is EXPENSIVE and ERROR-PRONE. Prevent them
by respecting 60/60 from the start.
