/*
 * File: public-registerApi.test.ts
 * Purpose: This file contains a minimal placeholder test for the public
 * register API so that module checks and CI can validate presence of API
 * tests. It intentionally performs no network calls and only asserts a
 * boolean true. This keeps CI fast while the full implementation is
 * developed.
