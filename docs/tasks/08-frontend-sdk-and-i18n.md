# Task 08 â€” Frontend SDK baseline and i18n scaffold

Description

- Generate/import SDK and replace direct fetch/axios in a sample hook.
- Add i18n provider scaffold with default locale and message loader.
- Do not change routes yet; locale prefix happens in Task 19.

Expected Result

- SDK available and used in one sample feature. i18n provider mounted at app
  root with basic messages.

Actual Result

- Implemented temporary SDK wrapper at src/shared/sdk/index.ts.
- Added i18n scaffold at src/shared/i18n and wrapped App in main.tsx.
- No direct fetch usage in app code for health sample.
