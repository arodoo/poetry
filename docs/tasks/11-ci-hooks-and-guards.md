# Task 11 — CI Hooks and Guards

Description

- Set up Husky hooks, commitlint, and checks for OpenAPI validity and SDK/type
  parity. Enforce max 80 lines and 80 chars per line.

Expected Result

- Pre-commit: lint/format/max-lines. Pre-push: test/typecheck/build. CI fails on
  drifts (OpenAPI vs SDK, schema vs code), lint, tests.

Prerequisites

- 02 — Backend foundation; 06 — Env vars; 09 — Line & file limits.

Actual Result

- Implemented Husky pre-commit and pre-push hooks.
- Added commitlint with conventional config.
- Added redocly OpenAPI validation and SDK drift check.
- Split check-lines.mjs into modular components (≤80 lines each).
- Fixed frontend test unhandled rejections properly.
- All CI/CD rules enforced: lint, format, max-lines, typecheck, tests.
- Wired root scripts to run frontend and backend.
- Added LICENSE-HEADER.txt for backend build compatibility.
