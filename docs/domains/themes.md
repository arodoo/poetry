# Themes â€” Domain

Scope

- Manage UI themes available globally (future: per org override).

Functional Requirements

- CRUD themes, activate exactly one global active theme, list for UI tokens.

Data Model

- Theme(id, name, active, colors map, deletedAt).
- Color values stored as HSL strings (e.g. hsl(210 40% 96%)) or hex fallback.

API References

- Paths: /api/v1/themes, /api/v1/themes/{id}, /api/v1/themes/{id}/activate,
  /api/v1/themes/active.

Permissions

- Admin/Manager (authorization integration pending).

Acceptance Criteria

- Endpoints implemented and returning ProblemDetails on validation errors.
- Single active theme invariant enforced by ActivateThemeUseCase.
- Soft deleted themes excluded from queries.
- Seeder provides initial 10 themes using HSL values.

Fallback Strategy (Selection Resolution)

Order applied when resolving current UI customization selection:

1. Stored system selection if present and its theme still exists.
2. Stored selection with substituted theme (first available or "default") if
   original theme removed.
3. Active theme from domain if no stored selection.
4. First available theme key or literal fallback "default" when none active.

Rationale: Guarantees deterministic frontend configuration while preserving
user/system intent when possible and avoiding errors during theme removal or
early bootstrap phases.
