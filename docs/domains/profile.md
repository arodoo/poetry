# Domain: Profile

## Scope

Provide authenticated users with visibility into personal account details and
tools to update their display name while coordinating password management with
account security flows.

## Functional Requirements (RFs)

- Retrieve profile summary including display name, email, locale, and version.
- Allow updating the display name using optimistic concurrency.
- Surface localized metadata for audit timestamps and locales.
- Delegate password management to the account security module.

## Data Model

| Aggregate      | Fields                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| ProfileSummary | username, email, locale, version |

## API References

- `docs/api/openapi/paths/profile-summary.yaml`

## Permissions

- All endpoints require an authenticated session scoped to the tenant.
- Updates require ownership of the target profile resource.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Summary response validates schema and mirrors backend invariants.
- Update returns 200 with refreshed summary payload when successful.
- Conflicting version yields 412 Precondition Failed with problem details.
- Validation failures return RFC7807 payload with localized error codes.
