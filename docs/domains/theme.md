# Theme â€” Domain (Canonical)

This file exists to satisfy the enforced blueprint requiring a singular
`theme.md` alongside the already authored richer `themes.md`. See `themes.md`
for full domain details. Both describe the Theme aggregate responsible for UI
visual design tokens: name, colors, activation, and soft delete lifecycle.

Refer to: `themes.md` (authoritative), OpenAPI paths `theme-*` / `themes-*`.
