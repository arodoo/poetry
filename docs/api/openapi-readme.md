# OpenAPI Contracts

- The OpenAPI v1 spec is available at runtime at `/v3/api-docs`.
- Versioned contracts will be stored here for SDK generation and CI validation.

Pending (aligned with MainTask):
- Export OpenAPI from poetry-backend (springdoc) and save JSON snapshot in this directory.
- Configure TypeScript SDK generation in frontend and validate types with Zod at runtime.
