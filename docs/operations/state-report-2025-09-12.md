# Purpose: Concise, accurate snapshot of current repo state across

# backend, frontend, docs, and tooling. Assesses readiness and gaps

# with actionable next steps. All Rights Reserved. Arodi Emmanuel

## Overview

- Monorepo with Spring Boot backend and Vite React frontend.
- DDD/Clean layering present; headers and 60-line rules enforced.
- OpenAPI v1 modularized; frontend uses typed schemas and React Query.

## Backend (poetry-backend)

- Stack: Spring Boot 3.5, Java 21, Web, Validation, Actuator, JPA/H2, springdoc.
  Port `8080`. App base path `/api/v1`.
- Live endpoints verified:
  - GET `/api/v1/auth/status` → `{ authenticated: boolean }`.
  - POST `/api/v1/admin/echo` → `{ message: string }` with validation.
- Structure: Application ports (`AdminEchoUseCase`), services
  (`AdminEchoService`), interfaces/controllers for v1.
- Build: `mvnw -DskipTests package` succeeds; JSON logging enabled.
- Security: No RBAC enforcement yet on controllers; crypto/JJWT libs present but
  not wired. Principal-based status only.

## Frontend (poetry-frontend)

- Stack: React 19, Vite 7, TypeScript 5.8, TanStack Query 5, Zod 3, Tailwind 4.
  i18n generation/verification pre-steps integrated.
- Features implemented: tokens (UI), auth (status + guards scaffolds), admin
  (echo). Stable query keys; no hardcoded URLs (SDK/http client).
- Tests: Extensive unit tests for UI library, tokens, i18n, admin/auth. Prior
  parse issues with `.ts` JSX resolved (moved to `.tsx`).
- Build/test gates: lint, typecheck, i18n checks, vitest in CI scripts.

## OpenAPI & Docs

- `docs/api/openapi-v1.yaml` includes `/v1/auth/status` and `/v1/admin/echo`.
  Path files exist and are clean of TODOs.
- Architecture blueprints for backend/frontend and DB present.
- Domain docs stubs exist for many areas; require content completion.

## Tooling & Policies

- ESLint/Prettier, Checkstyle configs, Spotless (Java) apply on validate.
- Header policy enforced via `tools/ci/headers/check-headers.mjs`.
- Max 60 lines per file policy active; short-line formatting observed.

## Current State Summary

- Backend is running; 2 real endpoints live and tested.
- Frontend compiles; unit tests pass locally per recent runs; uses schemas and
  mocks to avoid network in tests.
- RBAC, token auth flows, and persistence are not fully wired.

## Risks / Gaps

- Auth: Login/refresh/me/logout routes in OpenAPI lack implementation.
- RBAC: Controller-level authorization annotations not applied yet.
- Error model: Global exception/i18n error mapper not centralized.
- Frontend: Some admin UI is skeletal; tokens UI lacks persistence.

## Next Steps (Actionable)

- Backend: Implement auth flows and RBAC, add MVC tests, central error handler
  with i18n. Wire idempotency and ETag filters consistently.
- Frontend: Generate OpenAPI client (if planned), add react-query hooks for auth
  flows, complete admin pages. Strengthen a11y tests.
- Docs: Complete domain docs and keep OpenAPI in sync with code.
